<h2>The Halfway Child</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game uses original design and movement mechanics, original sound and music, as well as an original story told through gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The jumping system utilizes nonlinear vertical acceleration, platforming created with tilemaps, animations, parallax backgrounds, and state switching.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned about the difficulties of generating collision tilemaps(I couldn't get it working how I wanted) and animations (also couldn't get working quite how I wanted)</li>
<li> The easiest part was the basic mechanic (platforming) and loading in assets. The hardest parts were the animations and collision tilemapping.
</li>
