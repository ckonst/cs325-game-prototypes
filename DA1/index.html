<h2>Biggie Cheese Challenge</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game uses original design and movement mechanics, original sound and music, as well as an original story told through gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The jumping system utilizes nonlinear vertical acceleration, timed enemy movement changes, custom damage system with invulnerablity frames, and state switching.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned a lot about how games are coded in Javascript, and about Javascript itself. I learned about Phaser's api and general structure and that making games
is really hard even if they are very small.</li>
<li> The easiest part was actually the actual algorithms of accomplishing the desired effect. I have made a game before so I generally know about coding inside update functions.
Usually problems I encountered (the hard part) was with trying to figure out Javascript and Phaser (syntax and structure of the program/libraries).

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Play as Biggie Cheese and shoot your enemies out of your minecraft base in this action-packed challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I don't know what to put here.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To test jumping, movement, shooting projectiles, hit detection, damage systems, enemy movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Hopefully the player will be confused and slighly amused. It's important that they can get a good chuckle from this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player Actions:
<li>Movement: WASD or Arrow keys</li>
<li>Shooting: F</li>
<li>Jump: Spacebar</li>
<li>In the main menu use mouse to click the play button. Shoot at the enemy to kill it. Kill the enemy to win the game.</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Jumping into the bottom of the platforms will suspend you in mid-air and will (unintentionally) put you in an advantageous position to kill the intruder.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The basic premise is that you are the Biggie Cheese, world renoun musical rat. When you enter into the game, there is a certain intruder that must be repelled from your minecraft base.
In order to do so, you must hand the intruder FAT Ls. Doing so successfully will result in a victory for the boys.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People with a fresh sense of humor and an appreciation for memes.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1-2 minutes.
</li>
