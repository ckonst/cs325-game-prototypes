<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong></li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/starstruck</strong></li>
<li>Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>
<li>code also borrowed from: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/bounding-box
</li>
<li>and: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/text/center-text</li>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Play as Biggie Cheese and shoot your enemies out of your minecraft base in this action-packed challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Hopefully the player will be confused and slighly amused. It's important that they can get a good chuckle from this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Jumping into the bottom of the platforms will suspend you in mid-air and will (unintentionally) put you in an advantageous position to kill the intruder.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People with a fresh sense of humor and an appreciation for memes.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1-2 minutes.
</li>
